Cheap flight finder
===================

Build a small web app using the *live Ryanair API* for cheap flight information. The web app should have at least the following components:

1.  A form which allows a user to choose an origin, a destination, and a date period. The origins/destinations should be taken from a web service (see below);

2. When a button is pressed, a component which shows all the information relating to the cheapest flight between those points, for the chosen date period

*This must be coded as a single page Javascript application.*

Installation
------------

**1. Clone the project **
```git clone https://github.com/proudlygeek/cheap-flights.git```

**2. Install the dependencies via NPM**
```npm install```

**3. Run the local app server**
```npm run serve```

This will serve the app on ```http://localhost:9000```
