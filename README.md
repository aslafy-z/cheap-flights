Cheap flight finder
===================

Build a small web app using the *live Ryanair API* for cheap flight information. The web app should have at least the following components:

1.  A form which allows a user to choose an origin, a destination, and a date period. The origins/destinations should be taken from a web service (see below);

2. When a button is pressed, a component which shows all the information relating to the cheapest flight between those points, for the chosen date period

*This must be coded as a single page Javascript application.*

Points are given for:
---------------------
- Style and colour
- Error handling
- User experience considerations
- Using AngularJS and vanilla JS.
- Modularity (re-usability of component code)
- Responsive design

Extra points are given for:
--------------------------

- Automated testing
- Cross browser considerations
- Autocompletion (some data is interlinked, don't make the user think!)
- Work that goes above and beyond the brief

Points will be subtracted for:
------------------------------

- Using jQuery :)
